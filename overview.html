         <p>The goal of this project is to discuss possible transit improves within the bounds of the NY Metro Area, achieving the goals set out by UN Goal 11 and UN Goal 16.</p>
         <p><br></p>
         <p>To achieve this, we set out a plan to use real traffic data through the <a href="https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api/documentation/tomtom-maps/traffic-flow/traffic-flow-service">TomTom Traffic API</a> to find common routes people use.</p>
         <p><br></p>
         <p>Then, after finding routes that are both considered fast and short, can the NYC's subway be extended/improved to better serve this car route, so that we can reduce emissions, noise pollution, and traffic in NYC.</p>
         <p><br></p>
         <P>Finally, after compiling data for several hundred routes, we chose 10 of the highest correlated routes to analyze and see how/if subway service could work.</P>     
         <p><br></p>
         <p>As for UN Goals 11 and 16, this project can be used to identify where the NYC Subway falls short of its goal of optimizing transit within NY. Clearly, improving transit works with Goal 11 to improve cities and make them more sustainable, but it also promotes Goal 16 in having more sustainable development and improving our institutions. </p>
